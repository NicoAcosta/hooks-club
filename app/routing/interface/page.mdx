# Uniswap Interface

[Uniswap interface](https://app.uniswap.org/) is managed by Uniswap Labs, and all the routing logic is handled by their team.

At protocol level, users and contracts can choose which versions and pools (including those with hooks) they want to use when swapping. And being a permissionless protocol, anyone can create pools with any hooks contract.

We must consider that hooks implementations can include bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious code that could affect LPs and traders funds. Therefore, Uniswap Labs interface features a manual approval process for hooks contracts to be routed.

The approval process is designed to ensure that only trusted hooks contracts are used in the Uniswap interface, protecting users and their funds from potential exploits or security breaches.

Approval criteria might include security (audits) and traction (TVL).

We can find a list of currenlty whitelisted hooks [here](https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/33829289869965-How-do-custom-hooks-work-in-the-Labs-interface).
