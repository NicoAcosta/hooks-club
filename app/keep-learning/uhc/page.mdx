# Uniswap Hooks Course

[Uniswap Hook Course](https://atrium.academy/uniswap/course) is designed for developers who want the same in-depth knowledge as the Uniswap Hook Incubator but at your own pace.

## Why This Course

This course will give you all the tools and skills to build and deploy real-world hooks.

-   **Comprehensive Knowledge**: Learn directly from Uniswap v4 experts and get practical insights into decentralized finance (DeFi).

-   **Capstone Project**: Build production-ready hooks that can be deployed on Uniswap v4, creating real value.

-   **Office Hours & Events**: Join a network of developers working with Uniswap, receive peer support, and stay updated on the latest in Web3 development.

-   **Self-Paced Learning**: No deadlines—get lifetime access to all course materials and learn at your own speed.

## Modules

-   **Introduction**: Learn the evolution of Uniswap from v1 to v4, including architectural decisions and the problems hooks solve. Understand the mathematics behind Ticks & token pair prices. Deploy your first (Memecoin points) hook to Sepolia testnet.

-   **Liquidity Operators**: Learn to change how liquidity is controlled in a DEX by building an onchain limit order book. Understand the mechanism design behind a hook that modifies LP positions to optimize LP fees and create efficient markets.

-   **Dynamic Fees**: Leverage game theory to explore different hook designs that benefit traders and LPs under real-world conditions, including gas price based fees and Nezlobin's Directional Fee

-   **Return Delta Hooks**: Think sudo mode for hooks. Return delta hooks allow you to create completely custom derivative DEX designs. Explore custom CSMM based curves, Coincidence of Want designs, and reduce MEV with async swap fulfillments.

-   **Swap & Bridge Periphery Contracts**: Extend v4’s functionality even further with periphery contracts. Use a custom router to build a swap & bridge such that the output tokens of a swap are automatically bridged into a different chain using your bridge of choice.

-   **Capstone Project**: Design a custom hook with your own idea or seek inspiration from a “Request for Hooks” page. You’ll hack solo or in pairs and present your project in a demo day to a panel of investors & researchers. Top hooks will win prizes.
