## Roadmap

#### Week 1 - Introduction

Learn the evolution of Uniswap from v1 to v4, including architectural decisions and the problems hooks solve. Understand the mathematics behind Ticks & token pair prices. Deploy your first (Memecoin points) hook to Sepolia testnet.

#### Week 2 - Liquidity Operators

Learn to change how liquidity is controlled in a DEX by building an onchain limit order book. Understand the mechanism design behind a hook that modifies LP positions to optimize LP fees and create efficient markets.

#### Week 3/4 - Dynamic Fees

Leverage game theory to explore different hook designs that benefit traders and LPs under real-world conditions, including gas price based fees and Nezlobin's Directional Fee

#### Week 5 - Return Delta Hooks

Think sudo mode for hooks. Return delta hooks allow you to create completely custom derivative DEX designs. Explore custom CSMM based curves, Coincidence of Want designs, and reduce MEV with async swap fulfillments.

#### Week 6 - Swap & Bridge Periphery Contracts

Extend v4’s functionality even further with periphery contracts. Use a custom router to build a swap & bridge such that the output tokens of a swap are automatically bridged into a different chain using your bridge of choice.

#### Week 7/8 - Capstone Project

Design a custom hook with your own idea or seek inspiration from a “Request for Hooks” page. You’ll hack solo or in pairs and present your project in a demo day to a panel of investors & researchers. Top hooks will win prizes.

WIP.
