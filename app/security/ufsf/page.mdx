# Uniswap Foundation Security Fund

The Uniswap Foundation Security Fund (UFSF) is program that subsidizes smart contract audits for projects building in the Uniswap ecosystem, especially v4 hooks.

It works by whitelisting top audit firms, then letting eligible projects apply for partial or full coverage of audit costs. The goal is to improve security and accessibility for developers shipping new hooks or Uniswap-related protocols.
