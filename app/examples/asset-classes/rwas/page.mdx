# RWAs

As DeFi and TradFi become more interconnected, compliance is becoming increasingly important. Real world assets (RWA) are currently a hot topic and are expected to become even more significant in the future.

To comply with regulations, exchanges and protocols frequently need ways to whitelist or blacklist addresses. Many tokenization licenses also donâ€™t allow secondary market permissionless trading.

For these and many other reasons, implementing a permissioned (and compliant) trading system is often necessary.

Please check [Whitelist](/examples/access-control/whitelist).
